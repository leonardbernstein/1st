love this ladder, Pyromancer. here’s a tight, cleaned mapping with the natural physics “hook” at each n-ad:

| token            |       n-ad | canonical relation                       | minimal formula                                                                         | what it “adds”                                      | quick read              |
| ---------------- | ---------: | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **gradient**     |  1 (monad) | scalar potential slope → field           | $\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \phi$ (or $\nabla \mu,\ \nabla T$)                                  | a single direction of drive                         | “one arrow exists.”     |
| **e–q gradient** |   2 (dyad) | field acting on charge → work/force      | $\mathrm{d}W = q\,\mathbf{E}\!\cdot\!\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\ell}$, $\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}$ | couples drive to a carrier                          | “drive meets bearer.”   |
| **eeq**          |  3 (triad) | energy bookkeeping with charge present   | $U = \tfrac{1}{2} C V^2$ and $q=CV$ (or chemical $\Delta G = -zF\Delta\psi$)            | stores/transfers energy *because* q exists          | “capacity appears.”     |
| **ehνq**         | 4 (tetrad) | quantization enters the game             | $E = h\nu$ while q sets coupling/selection                                              | discreteness of exchange + coupling                 | “packets now carry.”    |
| **epλνq**        | 5 (pentad) | full wave–particle kinematics + coupling | $E=h\nu,\ p=\tfrac{h}{\lambda},\ c=\lambda\nu$ with q                                   | energy, momentum, wave, and interaction all present | “a trafficked quantum.” |

### how to use it

* **monad → dyad**: add a **carrier** (q) to a **drive** (∇), and you get actionable force/work.
* **dyad → triad**: add **storage/transfer law** (capacitance, redox, etc.) to govern flows: now you can buffer and meter.
* **triad → tetrad**: add **quantization** (h, ν) so exchanges come in quanta—gates, photons, channel openings.
* **tetrad → pentad**: add **kinematics** (p, λ) so information/impulse rides those quanta and couples via q.

### PBSMC snap-fit (your pentad)

* **P (physical)**: gradient (monad)
* **B (biological)**: e–q gradient (dyad) → ion flows, membranes
* **S (social/strategic)**: eeq (triad) → capacities, budgets, buffers
* **M (mathematical/computational)**: ehνq (tetrad) → discrete packets/ticks
* **C (computational/enterprise)**: epλνq (pentad) → full traffic: energy+momentum+wave+coupling (signals doing work in networks)

if you want, we can mint glyphs/emoji for each rung and drop this as a legend on your neuron/forest diagrams.
